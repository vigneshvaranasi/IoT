# IoT Repository

Welcome to my IoT Codes Repository! This repository is dedicated to storing and organizing my Internet of Things (IoT) projects and codes.

## Tinkercad Projects
I use Tinkercad to simulate and visualize my IoT projects. Here are the Tinkercad links for each project:

1. [Blink LED](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ekaijAE8kW1-blink-led?sharecode=rFEBUSJ7AA46itZOCZ9YbRePvzGm2rrReKe0IKkOYg8)
2. [Multi Color with RGB](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/aK4Zv5SNQMM-multi-color-with-rgb)
3. [Multi Color LED](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ju0kVfXq3Jd-multi-color-led)
4. [IR Sensor](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3FrGXe51j3Q-ir-sensor)

Feel free to explore the Tinkercad simulations to better understand the projects before implementing them.
